General information:
1. This is a personal project done by Luis Lopera.
2. The main aim is to improve my Deep Learnig skills aplying an Artificial Neural Network for classification and regression.
3. In this project I used two dataset from kaggle based on fetal health and insurance charges.

and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
4. All the necessary requirements are on requirements.txt

- Research question:
The Artificial Intelligence approach has been developed in many areas including Healthcare. So, in this case the idea is to apply and Artificial Neural Network to describe different patterns about health and its cost. So the two questions here are:

1. Is it possible to predict the insurance charge of a person based on their health and demographic characteristics?
2. Is it possible to classify the health condition of a fetal based on their medical test?
